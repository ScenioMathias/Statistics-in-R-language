Measures of Central Tendency and Variability

To start, let's define our range of values. In our scenario, we will assign a range of values to the variable "player". 
```{r}
jogadores = c(40000,18000,12000,250000,30000,140000,300000,40000,800000)
```
Now we will analyze measures of central tendency and variability. Such as Mean, Median, Quartiles, and Standard Deviation.

Mean
```{r}
mean(jogadores)
```

Median
```{r}
median(jogadores)
```

Quartiles
```{r}
quartis = quantile(jogadores)
quartis
```

Consulting the 3rd Quartile
```{r}
quartis[4]
```

Standard Deviation
```{r}
sd(jogadores)
```

Summary
```{r}
summary(jogadores)
```

Small and Large Samples

It is possible that small samples may have more variations in the mean values when compared to large samples. Here's an example.

Small Sample - With values from 1 to 6, repeated 6 times. Replace = True. Mean fluctuating between 2 and 5.
```{r}
x = sample(1:6,6,replace = T)
mean(x)
```
Large Sample - With values from 1 to 6, repeated 10000 times. Replace = True. Mean fluctuating between 3.4 to 3.5.
```{r}
x = sample(1:6,10000,replace = T)
mean(x)
```

Notice that the large sample had a much smaller fluctuation.

That's because it has greater precision of the data, reduced randomness, and stability.

Hello everyone! This is a repository where I'll be presenting introductory knowledge in Statistics using the R language.

Statistics plays a fundamental role in data analysis, as it provides the necessary tools to understand and interpret patterns and relationships in data. The R language is a powerful tool for statistical analysis, as it offers a wide range of functions and specialized packages to perform complex analyses efficiently and accurately. With R, data analysts can explore data, identify trends, test hypotheses, and create statistical models to make decisions.
